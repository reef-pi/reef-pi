## Contributing to reef-pi

We're glad you want to contribute to a reef-pi project! This document will help answer common questions you may have during your first contribution.

### Submitting Issues

Not every contribution comes in the form of code. Submitting, confirming, and triaging issues is an important task for any project. reef-pi uses Github to track all project issues.

### Contribution Process

- Commit changes to a git branch
- Create a Github Pull Request for your change
- Perform a Code Review with the project maintainers on the pull request.
- reef-pi uses Github actions to test all pull requests. reef-pi requires these test runs to succeed on every pull request before being merged.
